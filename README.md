# MlogAssertions

> [!TIP]
> This mod supports the latest Mindustry 8 Beta release. There's also a [version](https://github.com/cardillan/MlogAssertions-7) compatible with Mindustry 7, which is no longer being developed.

Mod for making debugging in Mindustry Logic a bit easier. Provided functionality:

* Settings for overriding instruction limit (the limit can be increased up to 2000 instructions). This allows you to insert debugging code (e.g., additional `print` instructions) into your code, even if the original instruction limit is exceeded.
* Buttons to copy the variables (including their full, unrounded values) and the processor's text buffer to clipboard. The variables can be pasted into a spreadsheet and sorted by name for easier inspection.
* Custom mlog instruction `assertBounds` for enhanced runtime checks in Mindustry Logic. (This instruction is generated by [Mindcode](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode) for runtime checks.) 

The mod is still under development. The precise specification of instructions may still change.
